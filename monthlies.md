# Hosting codebar Monthlies

The Monthlies were started in Central London in February 2015. This is an 
ongoing talks night event featuring speakers from diverse backgrounds and targeted 
towards beginners and junior developers.

## Organisation

If you are based in London and you'd like to get involved, email monthlies@codebar.io.

If you're outside of London and want to start running Monthlies, read on!

We try to host the Monthlies on the last Monday of each month, but sometimes Bank Holidays 
force us to move one week forward.

Components of running a Monthly:

* Speakers (2 main speakers, 2-4 lightning talk speakers)
* Venue with AV setup, enough space to hold at least 30 seated attendees theater-style
* MC/host
* Food & drinks
* Post-event pub

#### Timeline

###### Preparation

* 6-8 weeks before: Line up speakers and venues.
* 2 weeks before: Email speakers to confirm that they're ready to go. Confirm that they can arrive at the venue at 18:30 and provide them your mobile number.
* 1 week before: Set up event on website, send invitations, confirm that venue knows what they need to do.
* 2 days before: Send out reminder email to registered attendees, promote people off the waitlist if needed.
* Morning of: Send list of attendees to the venue if needed, print nametags
* 30 mins before: Organisers should arrive at venue and make sure space is set up, hang up signs with directions if needed
* Starting time: Greet your first arrivals!

###### During

#### Curating Talks

In Central London, we draw on our community for potential speakers. We reach out to coaches and students 
who we believe would be great speakers. We also use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeht2GO_PHM4WHjCmpNfdtlDdrGn9TQOSqhjY1i92L6iCQwPA/viewform) 
as an ongoing pipeline.

Many of our organisers and members regularly attend other talks events in London. We reach out to speakers 
with interesting perspectives or backgrounds to invite them to deliver the talk at a Monthly.

We strive for diversity in our speaking roster. In 2016, we featured at least one main speaker who identified as a woman or non-binary at every Monthly.

#### Speaking Guidelines

Talks do not need to be about code, but they should be broadly related to technology, because that's what we're all here to learn more about.

Speakers should err on the side of explaining more context with technical subjects. 
A heuristic that has worked well so far is to **imagine that all attendees have recently started
their first junior web developer role**, between zero and six months of professional working experience.

This means that you should feel empowered to use code snippets, but offer line-by-line 
explanations, no matter how brief. We find that giving a name to new concepts helps 
attendees to ask more helpful questions and/or do further research afterward. 

Beware of language such as "Obviously everybody knows that.." Do *not* assume that everyone 
in the audience knows a particular language, concept, person, book, etc. 

We discourage live-coding unless absolutely necessary, especially when the internet is required. 
We don't have control over the stability of guest network access at our venues.

#### Venue Guidelines

Venue sponsors are asked to supply food and drinks for 40-60 people if the event is in Central London. 
For newer chapters, the numbers may vary -- if you are not the primary chapter organiser, 
get in touch with them for a sense of how big the normal workshops are. Monthly attendance numbers will be similar.

*Food*: Please provide some vegetarian options, as well as options for people who are gluten-intolerant and vegan.

*Drink*: Alcoholic drinks are OK, but please provide soft drinks and/or access to tap water.

*Space*: The space should be set up theater-style, with chairs facing a screen or projector. Desks and power outlets are not necessary.

*AV*: Most speakers use devices that can output to HDMI or Thunderport. If the speakers' devices have special requirements, 
make sure this is communicated and sorted in advance of the day. A power outlet near where the speaker will be standing 
is also useful.
